# MY NIXOS CONFIG

## Introduction

I switched from Arch Linux to NixOS in July and I have not looked back. The amount of control within the NixOS configuration is amazing, way better than having to look for files all over the OS. I'm still a novice when it comes to NixOS, but this is my WIP configuration in case anyone wants a head start ;)

This configuration uses BSPWM, SXHKD and Polybar for window management using X11, which is the only one that's currently working. I'm working on implementing more and switching to Wayland, but that's not working as of right now.

## Todo

This configuration is a work-in-progress (WIP), meaning it's far from done and may change drastically.

TODO:

- [ ] Move configuration files into the `nixos` folder (bspwm, sxhkd, etc.)
- [ ] Make the configuration more modular (moving more settings into the `modules` folder)
- [ ] Add more options for window manager, text editor, etc.
